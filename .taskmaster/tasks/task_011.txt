# Task ID: 11
# Title: HID State Management and Synchronization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement state management for HID devices to ensure proper synchronization when switching between hosts.
# Details:
1. Create data structures to track complete HID state (pressed keys, mouse buttons, etc.)
2. Implement state update functions for USB input events
3. Create state flush mechanism for host switching
4. Ensure all keys/buttons are released when switching hosts
5. Implement state synchronization between boards via neighbor module
6. Handle edge cases like stuck keys

HID state tracking:
```c
typedef struct {
    uint8_t keyboard_report[8];  // Standard HID keyboard report
    uint8_t key_states[256/8];   // Bitmap of pressed keys
    uint8_t mouse_buttons;       // Mouse button state
    int16_t mouse_x;             // Relative mouse X movement
    int16_t mouse_y;             // Relative mouse Y movement
} hid_state_t;

void hid_state_update_key(uint8_t key, bool pressed);
void hid_state_update_mouse(uint8_t buttons, int16_t x, int16_t y);
void hid_state_flush(void);
bool hid_state_generate_reports(uint8_t *kb_report, uint8_t *mouse_report);
```

# Test Strategy:
Test state tracking with various input combinations. Verify all keys/buttons are properly released when switching hosts. Test edge cases like rapid key presses during host switching. Validate state synchronization between boards.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement State Update Functions [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create functions to update the HID state based on USB input events
### Details:
Implement hid_state_update_key() and hid_state_update_mouse() functions to modify the hid_state_t structure. Ensure proper handling of key presses/releases and mouse movements/clicks.

## 2. Develop State Flush Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Implement a mechanism to clear the HID state when switching hosts
### Details:
Create hid_state_flush() function to reset all fields in hid_state_t to their default values. Ensure all keys and buttons are marked as released.

## 3. Generate HID Reports [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Implement a function to generate standard HID reports from the current state
### Details:
Develop hid_state_generate_reports() to create keyboard and mouse HID reports based on the current hid_state_t. Handle conversion between internal state representation and standard HID reports.

## 4. Implement Inter-Board State Synchronization [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
### Description: Create a protocol for synchronizing HID state between boards using the neighbor module
### Details:
Design and implement a communication protocol to share hid_state_t between boards. Use the UART frame types INPUT_KEY and INPUT_MOUSE to transmit state changes to the neighbor board.

## 5. Handle Edge Cases and Error Conditions [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4
### Description: Implement robust error handling and manage edge cases like stuck keys
### Details:
Add timeout mechanisms for key presses to prevent stuck keys. Implement error checking in all functions and handle potential issues like buffer overflows or communication errors between boards.
