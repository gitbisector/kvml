# Task ID: 12
# Title: BLE Bonding and Persistent Identity Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement persistent BLE identity and bonding information storage to ensure consistent device recognition across reboots, with support for multiple simultaneous connections.
# Details:
1. Configure static MAC address for each board
2. Implement NVS storage for BLE bonding keys
3. Create functions to store/retrieve bonding information for multiple connections
4. Set fixed device name based on board identity
5. Implement bond management (list, delete, etc.)
6. Ensure bonding persists across firmware updates

BLE identity management:
```c
bool ble_load_bonding_info(void);
bool ble_save_bonding_info(void);
bool ble_delete_bonding(esp_bd_addr_t addr);
bool ble_list_bonded_devices(void);
void ble_set_static_identity(void);
```

NVS structure:
```
ble_bonds/     # Namespace for BLE bonding
  count        # Number of bonded devices
  dev_0        # Bonding data for device 0
  dev_1        # Bonding data for device 1
  ...
```

# Test Strategy:
Test BLE pairing with multiple host devices simultaneously. Verify bonding information persists across reboots and firmware updates. Test bond management functions. Validate that the BLE identity remains consistent.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Static MAC Address Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a function to set and store a static MAC address for each board based on its compile-time role.
### Details:
Implement ble_set_static_identity() function to assign and store a unique, static MAC address based on the BOARD_ROLE constant. Use NVS to persist this information.

## 2. Develop NVS Storage for BLE Bonding Keys [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Implement functions to save and load BLE bonding information using NVS storage.
### Details:
Create ble_save_bonding_info() and ble_load_bonding_info() functions to store and retrieve bonding keys in the 'ble_bonds' namespace. Use the NVS structure as specified in the task description.

## 3. Implement Bond Management Functions [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Create functions to list bonded devices and delete specific bonds.
### Details:
Implement ble_list_bonded_devices() to enumerate all bonded devices and ble_delete_bonding() to remove a specific bond. Update the 'count' value in NVS when adding or removing bonds.

## 4. Implement Multiple Connection Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2, 12.3
### Description: Extend the bonding system to support multiple simultaneous BLE connections.
### Details:
Modify the bonding system to track and manage multiple simultaneous connections. Update the NVS structure to store connection-specific information for each bonded device.

## 5. Ensure Bonding Persistence Across Firmware Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2, 12.3, 12.4
### Description: Implement mechanisms to preserve bonding information during and after firmware updates.
### Details:
Develop a system to backup and restore bonding information before and after firmware updates. This may involve creating a separate NVS partition for bonding data that remains untouched during updates.
