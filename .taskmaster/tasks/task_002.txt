# Task ID: 2
# Title: USB Host Implementation for HID Devices
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement USB host functionality to detect and interface with USB HID devices that may report as both keyboard and mouse simultaneously.
# Details:
1. Initialize USB host library for ESP32-S3
2. Implement device detection logic to identify HID devices
3. Create handlers for HID devices that can report as both keyboard and mouse
4. Implement HID report parsing for standard keyboard and mouse reports from the same device
5. Create state machine for USB device connection/disconnection events
6. Store device state in memory for forwarding to BLE interface
7. Add error handling for unexpected USB events

Code structure:
```c
typedef struct {
    bool connected;
    uint8_t device_capabilities; // Bitmask: DEVICE_CAP_KEYBOARD | DEVICE_CAP_MOUSE
    hid_device_info_t device_info;
    // Device state (key presses, mouse buttons, etc.)
} usb_device_state_t;

void usb_host_task(void *pvParameters);
void usb_event_handler(void *arg, esp_event_base_t event_base, int32_t event_id, void *event_data);
```

# Test Strategy:
Test with various USB HID devices including those that report as both keyboard and mouse simultaneously. Verify that the system correctly identifies device capabilities at runtime. Test hot-plugging scenarios and error recovery.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement USB Host Initialization [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the USB host library for ESP32-S3 and configure necessary parameters.
### Details:
Initialize USB host library, set up configuration parameters, enable USB OTG mode, and start the USB host task.

## 2. Develop HID Device Detection Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create a mechanism to detect and identify HID devices and their capabilities when connected.
### Details:
Implement device detection logic in the USB event handler, focusing on identifying HID devices and their capabilities (keyboard, mouse, or both).

## 3. Implement HID Report Parsing [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Create functions to parse standard HID reports for devices that may report as both keyboard and mouse.
### Details:
Develop parsing functions for HID reports that can handle devices reporting as both keyboard and mouse simultaneously, extracting relevant information such as key presses, mouse movements, and button clicks.

## 4. Create Device State Management [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Implement a system to manage and store the state of connected USB devices with multiple capabilities.
### Details:
Use the usb_device_state_t struct to store device information, connection status, capabilities, and current state. Implement functions to update and retrieve device states.

## 5. Develop Connection/Disconnection Handler [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4
### Description: Create a state machine to handle USB device connection and disconnection events.
### Details:
Implement a state machine in the USB event handler to manage device lifecycle events, including connection, disconnection, and runtime device capability detection.
