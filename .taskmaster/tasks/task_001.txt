# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Setup and ESP-IDF Configuration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with ESP-IDF framework, configure the build system, and set up the partition table as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
1. Create a new ESP-IDF project using the latest stable version
2. Configure CMakeLists.txt for dual ESP32-S3 target
3. Implement the partition table as specified in PRD:
   - nvs: 24KB for BLE bonding keys and config
   - ota_0: 1.5MB for firmware slot 1
   - ota_1: 1.5MB for firmware slot 2
   - spiffs: 512KB for Web UI and config files
4. Set up project structure with common code and board-specific modules
5. Configure logging levels and debug output
6. Initialize git repository with appropriate .gitignore

# Test Strategy:
Verify build system works for both ESP32-S3 boards. Test flash operations to ensure partition table is correctly applied. Validate that both boards can be programmed with the same firmware binary.
